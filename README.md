# Middleman::Search

LunrJS-based search for Middleman.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'middleman-search'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install middleman-search

## Usage

You need to activate the module in your `config.rb`, telling the extension how to index your resources:

```ruby
activate :search do
  search.resources = ['blog/', 'index.html', 'contactus/index.html']
  search.fields = {
    title:   {boost: 100, store: true, required: true},
    content: {boost: 50},
    url:     {index: false, store: true}
  }
end
```

Where `resources` is a list of the beginning of the URL of the resources to index (tested with `String#start_with?`), and `fields` is a hash with one entry for each field to be indexed, with a hash of options associated:

- `boost` Specifies lunr relevance boost when searching this field
- `store` Whether to store this field in the document map (see below), defaults to false
- `index` Whether to index this field, defaults to true
- `required` The resource will not be indexed if a field marked as required has an empty or null value

Note that a special field `id` is included automatically, with an autogenerated identifier to be used as the `ref` for the document.

All fields values are retrieved from the resource `data` (ie its frontmatter), or from a `data` hash inside its `options` in `resource.metadata`, except for:
- `url` which is the actual resource url
- `content` the text extracted from the rendered resource, without including its layout

You should also `require` the `lunr.min.js` file to your `all.js` file:

```javascript
//= require lunr.min
```

## Output

A file `index.json` (as well as a compressed `.gz` version, if compression is enabled in your project) will be generated in the project root, with a JSON object with two properties:
- `index` contains the serialised lunr.js index, which you can load via `lunr.Index.load(lunrData.index)`
- `docs` is a map from the autogenerated document ids to an object that contains the attributes configured for storage

You will typically load the `index` into a lunr index instance, and then use the `docs` map to look up the returned value and present it to the user.
